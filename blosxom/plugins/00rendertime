=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plugin: rendertime

=head1 USAGE

This plugin is used to figure out how long it is taking for Blosxom to render
a page.  Drop this file into your blosxom plugins directory and make sure
it is the first plugin that will be run (i.e. rename to B<00rendertime> or
something similar based on your plugin runtime priority naming scheme).
Then for each request this plugin will oompute the render time and log that
time to the configured location.  The log times are in seconds and are of
the form x.xxxx.  The following configuration variables are available:

B<$logToErrorLog>: log render times to the web server error log (1 = yes, 0 = no)

B<$logToFile>: log render times to a file (1 = yes, 0 = no)

B<$logFile>: the location of the log file to write render times to

B<$logToPage>: log the render time to the generated page (1 = yes, 0 = no)

B<$replacement_string>: the string to search for and replace with the render
time in the generated page

When the B<$logToPage> option is turned ON then a render time is computed
in the B<last> routine.  The B<last> routine is called by Blosxom before the
page is sent to the client.  This allows the render time to be injected into
the outgoing page wherever the B<$replacement_string> is found.  Therefore,
this render time will not be completely accurate.  Make note of whatever
plugins run after this plugins in the B<last> and B<end> routines as these
calls will not be part of the computed time.

The B<$logToErrorLog> and B<$logToFile> options always compute the render time
in the B<end> routine.  Therefore, these times are a bit more accurate.  Also,
for these two options the request URI is also logged as well.

This plugin requires the B<gettimeofday> system call.

=head1 VERSION

1.5  added ability to inject the render time within the page itself

=head1 VERSION HISTORY

1.4  changed to run in the end routine and log entire the request URI
     including any query parameters

1.2  initial implementation
